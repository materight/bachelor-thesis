\chapter{Methodology}
\label{cha:methodology}

This chapter describes the methods used to build the prediction model.

The model is composed of two sub-models that cooperate to give accurate predictions. The first sub-model is used to get a forecast of the inflow rate for the following time intervals, using time series forecasting techniques. The second sub-model is used to get a forecast of the arrival rate at the checkouts, using the results of the first sub-model.
